    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction project! In this repository, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of three COVID-19 datasets: new daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases. These datasets were analyzed individually and then combined to gain valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.</p>

    <h2>Project Highlights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed three critical COVID-19 datasets.</li>
        <li>Utilized Neural Networks for predictive modeling.</li>
        <li>Predicted daily deaths and admissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset Sources</h2>

    <p>The datasets used in this project were obtained from NHS sources, ensuring data accuracy and consistency:</p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>I have performed a variety of data analysis techniques to understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. Some of the key findings include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Temporal trends in daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases.</li>
        <li>Correlations between various pandemic-related variables.</li>
        <li>Insights into the effectiveness of mitigation measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>

    <p>To gain deeper insights and provide valuable information for future planning, I used Neural Networks for predictive modeling. I trained the model on historical data to predict:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Daily deaths due to COVID-19.</li>
        <li>Daily hospital admissions related to COVID-19.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our predictive models have the potential to assist healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public in making informed decisions during the pandemic.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

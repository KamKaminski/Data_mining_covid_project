    <h1>COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction project! In this repository, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of three COVID-19 datasets: new daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases. These datasets were analyzed individually and then combined to gain valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.</p>

    <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed three critical COVID-19 datasets.</li>
        <li>Utilized Neural Networks for predictive modeling.</li>
        <li>Predicted daily deaths and admissions.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="analysis">
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>I have performed a variety of data analysis techniques to understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. Some of the key findings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Temporal trends in daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases.</li>
        <li>Correlations between various pandemic-related variables.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="predictive-modeling">
    <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
    <p>To gain deeper insights and provide valuable information for future planning, we used Neural Networks for predictive modeling. We trained the model on historical data to predict:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily deaths due to COVID-19.</li>
        <li>Daily hospital admissions related to COVID-19.</li>
        <li>Daily new cases of COVID-19.</li>
    </ul>

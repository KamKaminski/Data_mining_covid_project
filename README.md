# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction project! In this repository, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of three COVID-19 datasets: new daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases. These datasets were analyzed individually and then combined to gain valuable insights into the progression of the pandemic.

## Project Highlights

- Analyzed three critical COVID-19 datasets.
- Utilized Neural Networks for predictive modeling.
- Predicted daily deaths and admissions.

## Dataset Sources

The datasets used in this project were obtained from NHS sources, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

## Analysis

I have performed a variety of data analysis techniques to understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. Some of the key findings include:

- Temporal trends in daily admissions, total deaths, and new daily cases.
- Correlations between various pandemic-related variables.
- Insights into the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

## Predictive Modeling

To gain deeper insights and provide valuable information for future planning, we used Neural Networks for predictive modeling. We trained the model on historical data to predict:

- Daily deaths due to COVID-19.
- Daily hospital admissions related to COVID-19.
- Daily new cass of Covid-19.
